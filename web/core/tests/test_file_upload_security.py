"""
Security tests for file upload functionality.

Files are stored in PostgreSQL as BLOBs with Content-Disposition: attachment.
Filename sanitization is NOT needed because:
- Django's BadHeaderError blocks header injection
- No filesystem access (files stored in DB)
- Modern browsers ignore path traversal in downloads

REAL security concerns:
- Authorization bypass (cross-team access)
- File size limits (resource exhaustion)
