# Red Team Submission Guide

How to submit and manage your findings in the WCComps scoring portal.

## Submitting a Finding

Navigate to `/scoring/red-team/` and fill out the form.

### 1. Attack Details

- **Attack Type** — pick from the dropdown (e.g., RCE, SQL Injection, Brute Force)
- **Source IP** — either enter a single IP address, or select one of your IP pools if you're rotating through multiple addresses

### 2. Target Information

- **Affected Boxes** — click the buttons for the systems you compromised. Target IPs and available services auto-populate based on your selection.
- **Affected Service** — which service on the box was exploited (dropdown filters based on selected boxes)

### 3. Attack Characteristics

- **Universally attempted** — check this if you tried the attack against all teams
- **Persistence established** — check this if you maintained persistent access

### 4. Attack Outcomes

Check all that apply. These determine point deductions per affected team:

| Outcome | Deduction |
|---|---|
| Root/Admin access | -100 |
| User access (only scored if no root) | -25 |
| Privilege escalation | -100 |
| Credentials recovered | -50 |
| Sensitive files recovered | -25 |
| Credit cards recovered | -50 |
| PII recovered | -200 |
| Encrypted DB recovered | -25 |
| DB decrypted | -25 |

The total deduction per team updates in real time as you check boxes.

### 5. Affected Teams

Click team number buttons to select which teams were compromised. "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons are available.

### 6. Evidence

Upload screenshots, logs, or other proof — up to 20 files, max 50MB each.

### 7. Notes

Free text for additional context about the attack.

## Viewing Your Findings

| Page | URL |
|---|---|
| All findings | `/scoring/red-team/scores/` |
| Single finding | `/scoring/red-team/score/<id>/` |

The findings list supports filtering by status (pending/approved), team, attack type, and submitter.

You can **delete** your own findings as long as they haven't been approved yet. If your submission was merged with someone else's, you can **leave** the finding to remove yourself as a contributor.

## IP Pool Management

If you're rotating through multiple source IPs, you can save them as reusable pools instead of entering a single IP each time.

| Action | URL |
|---|---|
| View your pools | `/scoring/red-team/ip-pools/` |
| Create a pool | `/scoring/red-team/ip-pools/create/` |
| Edit a pool | `/scoring/red-team/ip-pools/<id>/edit/` |
| Delete a pool | `/scoring/red-team/ip-pools/<id>/delete/` |

You can also create a new pool on the fly from the submission form using the "Create Pool" button.

## Duplicate Detection

If you submit a finding that matches an existing one (same attack type on the same box), the system may automatically merge your submission with the existing finding. You'll be added as a contributor and notified.

## What Happens After You Submit

1. Your finding is created (or merged with an existing duplicate)
2. Gold Team reviews the finding
3. Once approved, the point deductions are applied to the affected teams' scores

## API / Scripted Submissions

There is no dedicated REST API for submitting findings — submission is form-based and requires browser authentication with CSRF tokens.

If you have existing scripts using legacy field names, the following mappings are supported:

| Legacy field | Current field |
|---|---|
| `attack_vector` | `attack_type` |
| `affected_box` | `affected_boxes` |
| `target_teams` | `affected_teams` |
