## Resolved Decisions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Inject grading scale | Points vary per inject; White Team enters score AND optionally max points |
| Email notifications | WCComps sends emails (SMTP) for: packets, passwords, registration/payment info |
| Data retention | Admin-triggered archive + delete from live system; past results not viewable after archive |
| Ticket category points | Hardcoded per category (see table below) |
| Incident↔Finding matching | Primarily one-to-one; allow flexibility for edge cases |
| Rejected items | Just skipped (stays in system, not matched/approved) |
| In-person competition | Authentik-only auth; Discord features disabled |
